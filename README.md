# compare-pdf
Offline, reproducible PDF comparison: extract paragraphs/images/tables → match → diff → annotate PDFs → export reports. Local Web UI lets users upload two files, track progress, preview originals and annotated PDFs side-by-side, see a change list with page/bbox hints, and download all artifacts. No LLM features included.
